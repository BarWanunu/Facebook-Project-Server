# Our Workflow 
We organized our project using the MVC architecture. <br>
Initially, we focused on implementing the signup, signin, and token functions to ensure everything was working properly. Then, we proceeded to work on the remaining functions. <br>
Throughout our development process, we carefully reviewed every detail we modified on the server to ensure that the React and Android behavior met our expectations. <br>
Once everything was functioning as expected, we uploaded our program. <br>
