Our Workflow
We organized our project using the MVC architecture.
Initially, we focused on implementing the signup, signin, and token functions to ensure everything was working properly. Then, we proceeded to work on the remaining functions.
Throughout our development process, we carefully reviewed every detail we modified on the server to ensure that the React and Android behavior met our expectations.
Once everything was functioning as expected, we uploaded our program.
